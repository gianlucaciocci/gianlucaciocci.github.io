- Setting up a Software demo architecture
    - flexible
    - containerized environment for demos
    - challenging demo sofware on real infrastuctures matching close to production
    - Allow end-user to demo software on their own infrastucture tweaking parameters on cluster size and so on
    
### Terraform: key features

1. Infrastucture as a Code
    - High-level configuration syntax used to describe the infrastucture, allowing datacenter bluprints to be versioned and treated as you would any other code.
    - Infrastuctures can be shared and re-used within DR strategies 
2. Execution Plans
    - It is generated by a planning step appoach
    - I shows what Terraform will do when you `apply` the configuration. No surprises while manipulating infrastuctures
3. Resource Graph
    - Graph of all your resources
    - Parallel creation / changes of any npn-depended resources
4. Change Automation
    - Complex changeset can be applied to your infrastucture with minimal human interaction
    - You will always in control of the changes, dependencies and execution steps avoiding many possible human errors
