This week I've had the pleasure of running a session at the [DevOps focus group](http://devopsfocusgroups.com/) in London with title **"Culture eats strategy for breakfast"**. In year of experience, I never saw so much energy talking about DevOps from people attending conferences. Being in that room I felt the pain that managers, developers and ops guys are going through as of all the challenges, none provide greater obstacles than dealing with cultural issues that arise from a startegy execution. DevOps implementations are not easy as many are trying to "sell" it. This time we are not talking about implementing a new shiny devops tool, now we are getting serious: we are talking about a **culture change**, it's scary and quite overwhelming if not "managed with care".

### Culture eats strategy for breakfast

The management guru Peter Drucker once famously said:
> Culture eats strategy for breakfast

The allusion to the fact that the formulation and the planning of a company strategy are essentially processes or tasks that can be described, documented, measured and completed. The execution of strategies, however, even relative straightforward actions defined could end up into something significantly more complex and painful to execute, most notably because of culture.  
Indeed, strategy execution efforts, fail to deliver expected benefits due to mis-alignements with company culture. Often we've seen that this situation prelude a clash of clan, where cultural resistance overrules the implementation.

### Trasforming fear into continuous improvement challenges

A great series of [blog posts](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/deep-thought-intro-series-blogs-devops-stephen-walters?trk=prof-post) have been written by [Stephen Walters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/1stephenwalters) on his LinkedIn profile. Steve talks about DevOps implementation in Enterprises and about tre common questions asked by everyone:

1. What does DevOps is?
2. How can we implement DevOps in our companies?
3. What benefits can get out of it?

You are thinking, well these are legitimate questions with a clear answer to it. Yes, you are right..the problem here is that these are the wrong questions to ask to implement DevOps cultural changes.  
In many conversations I had with companies undertaking DevOps trasformations almost every time talking about culture and people the word "fear" popped up like a jocker-in-a-box. "Fear of failure", "it's the way it is", "moving torwards DevOps, people will loose their job" are just few examplea of what people feel torward changes.  
Fortunately this is all a big mistake. There is no fear in changes, there are opportunities, opportunities for improvements, to get better, strive and grow. Asking the right questions we will see all these buzzing words making sense. So what should we ask ourselve?  

**Why do I want change torward DevOps?** That's the Queen of all questions.  

Focusing on the **why** rather on the **what** we've been given the opportunity to think about improvements, about what benefits can bring a DevOps transformation to our business or to our career. The why question touches the Culture not the implemntation of a DevOps tool strategy.  

### What to take-away?

As following, I've tried to summarize what could make us stronger on culture changes avoiding to get stuck in vortex of fear and resistance. What is important to remember is that we are on a journey done a day at the time.

- Cultural change must not be done in isolation, but tightly-linked to the strategic goals of the enterprise.
- Start small setting out an adaptive culture rather a big bang changes approach: let culture evolve with the strategy.
- Check where you are. Monitor and assess frequently the gap between the current and the desired culture.
- Formulate values that are meaningful and really do drive organisational and behavioural change.
- Ensure that policies, procedures and decision rights support cultural values defined.
- Management commitment and ownership is key for a successful culture change.
- Support and celebrate cultural champions who demonstrate the new values and behaviours.
- Ensure that values are considered in all decision-making and public actions.
- Drive the changes with role-model behaviours amongst leaders and managers and ensure governance mechanisms.
- Ensure a strategy-aligned culture.
- Say "Thank you" for every feedback given.
