Midnight. Friday night. I've just gone live with my new project. 
I've spent the last few years working with interesting technologies in the DevOps world - **let's call it DevOps movement** - and I need a place where I can write my notes, 
write down what I learn trying new and old technologies out. **I hate paper**. You can't search for anything on it. Useless.

Please don't get frustrated if you can't read anything in the next couple of weeks, I am working on organizing the first [Enterprise DevOps meetup](http://www.meetup/entdevops) in London and the spare time I have is limited.
If on the 14th of September you want to come and see what kind of community we are trying to build, join the group following [this](http://wwww.meetup.com/entdevops) and RSVP.

If you have any questions or you want to know details of the event, get in touch with me using the social links on the side of page.

I am looking forward to seeing you there. Come and say hi.

Gianluca
