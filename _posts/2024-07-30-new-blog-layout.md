Docker can be considered a growing container technology. Behind it there is what I consider one of the most innovative company of the century ( [Docker Inc](https://www.docker.com/company) ) and an amazing community improving and mantaining this interesting technology.  

As I wanted to try out the new features introduced by the latest version of docker platform, I thought to write down few notes as memorandum. My playgroung is an Ubuntu Server 16.04 machine on Azure and the docker engine.

Let's copy and paste few information from the Docker official documentation to start with and set the scene.

Docker is supported on the following Ubuntu operating system versions:
- Ubuntu Xenial 16.04 [LTS]
- Ubuntu Wily 15.10
- Ubuntu Trusty 14.04 [LTS]
- Ubuntu Precise 12.04 [LTS]
