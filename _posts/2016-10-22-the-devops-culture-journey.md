This week I've had the pleasure of running a session at the [DevOps focus group](http://devopsfocusgroups.com/) in London titled **"Culture eats strategy for breakfast"**.

I want to thank you all the attendees as I had fun having an energetic conversation about DevOps culture. It's an interesting topic that touches the entire organization and it dosen't matter if you are an C-level manager, a developer or an ops guy, everyone feels the same.  

Culture change is challenging and frustrating.  

DevOps implementations are not easy as many are trying to "sell" it. This time is not the new shiny devops tool we are talking about, but something scary and quite overwhelming if not "managed with care".

Time to be more positive, now!!! DevOps is fun. It gives us the opportunity to actually make better what we've been moaning about all entire life.  
In Italy there is a saying:
>Keep close friends and family, keep closer your enemy!

And we all know who the enemy is here. Right?

You'll find listed here few take-away from that session that can be sticked on the side of your monitor and shared with your colleagues.

### Culture eats strategy for breakfast

The management guru Peter Drucker once famously said:
> Culture eats strategy for breakfast

The allusion to the fact that the formulation and the planning of a company strategy are essentially processes or tasks that can be described, documented, measured and completed. The execution of strategies, however, even relative straightforward actions defined could end up into something significantly more complex and painful to execute, most notably because of culture.

Indeed, strategy execution efforts, fail to deliver expected benefits due to mis-alignement with company culture. Often we've seen that this situation prelude a clash of clan, where cultural resistance overrules the implementation.

### Trasforming fear of changes into continuous improvement

A great series of [blog posts](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/deep-thought-intro-series-blogs-devops-stephen-walters?trk=prof-post) have been written by [Stephen Walters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/1stephenwalters) on his LinkedIn profile. Steve talks about DevOps implementation in Enterprises and about the tre common questions always asked:

1. What does DevOps is?
2. How can we implement DevOps in our companies?
3. What benefits can get out of it?

Fair questions you think and I agree. Unfortuanately, my experience tells me something is not quite right.  

Take the first question for example. In many conversations I had with people undertaking DevOps trasformations we ended up trying to give a definition to DevOps and what implementation is talking about tooling.

We all heard about stunning DevOps feary tales from the unicorn companies and the impact of their company culture on the success of the overall transformation. I think this is fantastic and we should learn from it a lot and even though, very often confusion and frustration is a general feeling. The frustration leads to uncertanty that in turn leads to fear of failure. For example, I heard people saying that implementing DevOps they will lose their job. You already know your DevOps trasformation where is going to go.  

Fortunately this can be managed and turned in a positive outcome. In a simplistic way, if you promote collaboration and support people up-skilling this will lead to improvements and then as a conseguence in company grow.

Okay Gianluca, we are clear on that, so what should we asking ourselve to make all this happen?  

**Why do I want move/change torward DevOps?** That's the Queen of all questions.  

Focusing on the **why** rather on the **what** gives you the opportunity to think about improvements and benefits than can be undertaken to add value to our career and in the meantime support the grow of the company we work for in a sustainable way.

### To take-away, please...

Trying to collect few thoughts here and there on what could make us stronger on culture changes avoiding getting stuck in vortexes of fear and resistance, you'll find below a list of "commandements" that could be useful to share with friend and colleagues.  
What is important to remember is that we are on a journey done a day at the time. Think about a couple of years trip to start getting productive in a true DevOps fashion.

Summing up what came out from the focus group:

- Cultural change must not be done in isolation, but tightly-linked to the strategic goals of the enterprise.
- Start small setting out an adaptive culture rather a big bang changes approach: let culture evolve with the strategy.
- Check where you are. Monitor and assess frequently the gap between the current and the desired culture.
- Formulate values that are meaningful and really do drive organisational and behavioural change.
- Ensure that policies, procedures and decision rights support cultural values defined.
- Management commitment and ownership is key for a successful culture change.
- Support and celebrate cultural champions who demonstrate the new values and behaviours.
- Ensure that values are considered in all decision-making and public actions.
- Drive the changes with role-model behaviours amongst leaders and managers and ensure governance mechanisms.
- Ensure a strategy-aligned culture.
- Say "Thank you" for every feedback given.

I'd like to hear about your experience on your DevOps journey and how you are shaping your dream-team.
